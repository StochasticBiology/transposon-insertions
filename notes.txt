simulate-ifrs.c
  C code simulating random transposon insertions of given frequencies in genomes of given lengths. Many insertion sets are simulated, then statistics of insertion-free regions are reported.

plot-ifr-prob.sh
  Gnuplot script plotting the output of the above for comparison and for comparison with p = 0.05 thresholds.
